module Iridium
  # Iridium supports two types of tests right out of the box
  #
  # 1. Integration Tests: These need a running Iridium::Application server
  # 2. Unit Tests: These tests don't need a running app server
  #
  # The tests are meant to be run with the $ iridium test PATH
  # command. 
  #
  # Examples:
  # $ iridium test test/**/*_test.*
  # $ iridium test test/integration/login_test.js
  # $ iridium test test/unit/validation_test.coffee
  #
  # Tests can be written either Coffeescript or Javascript.
  # Iridium handles the compilation from CS to JS for you
  # seamlessly. 
  #
  # == Behind the Scenes ==
  #
  # There are many different things that must happen for all this work
  # for the developer. Starting from the beginning, all coffeescript files
  # need to be compiled into javascript. This yields a directory tree of
  # javascript files. The application itself must be compiled so all the
  # assets available to the different test runners. Once we have all the 
  # javascript files and assets we can proceed to running tests.
  #
  # === Running Unit Tests ===
  #
  # The test process is different for integration tests and unit tests.
  # Unit tests are written for qUnit. Running qUnit test requires a HTML
  # file to load in qunit.js, qunit.css, all the application assets, and 
  # all the the test files. Running a unit test consists of:
  #
  # 1. Generating the proper HTML file to load everything
  # 2. Create a casperjs browser to navigate to that file
  # 3. Use casperjs to scrape the results
  # 4. Report the results
  #
  # === Running Integration Tests ===
  #
  # Integration tests are slightly less complicated. Running an integration
  # test consists of:
  #
  # 1. Start an Iridium::Application server
  # 2. Boot and point casperjs to the running server
  # 3. Casperjs executes the test
  # 4. Shutdown casper
  # 5. Shutdown the test server
  # 6. Report results
